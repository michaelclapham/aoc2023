# Michael Clapham - Advent of Code - 2023

I'm trying to do the advent of code here for 2023.

I'm trying to do each day in a different programming language, but we'll see how far I get...

# Day 1
Trying x86 Assembly (on Ubuntu) using
`sudo apt install nasm`
Rest of commands in `./day1/build.sh`

Learning from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGo2ldg2Mp0&list=PL2EF13wm-hWCoj6tUBGUmrkJmH1972dBB&index=6

# Day 2

Considering using Haskell.

Command to install...

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh` to install Haskell
